# *Project Overview*:
This project leverages Apache NiFi, a powerful data integration tool, to automate the ingestion, processing, and routing of multiple files. The processed data is then published to a Kafka topic, enabling real-time data streaming and integration with downstream systems. The project demonstrates the capabilities of Apache NiFi in handling complex data workflows and showcases its seamless integration with Apache Kafka for efficient data pipeline management.

# *Key Objectives*:

 - **Data Ingestion**: Use Apache NiFi to ingest multiple files from various sources, ensuring reliable and scalable data collection.

- **Data Processing**: Implement data transformation, enrichment, and validation workflows within Apache NiFi to prepare the data for downstream consumption.

- **Kafka Integration**: Publish the processed data to a Kafka topic, enabling real-time data streaming and integration with other systems or applications.

- **Workflow Automation**: Design and automate end-to-end data pipelines, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.

- **Monitoring and Error Handling**: Implement robust monitoring and error-handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity and pipeline reliability.

# *Methodology*:

- **Data Ingestion**: Configure Apache NiFi to collect files from diverse sources (e.g., local file systems, or APIs).

- **Data Transformation**: Use NiFi processors to clean, transform, and enrich the data (e.g., filtering, splitting, merging, or converting formats).

- **Kafka Publishing**: Stream the processed data to a Kafka topic using NiFi’s Kafka producers, ensuring low-latency and high-throughput data delivery.

- **Pipeline Optimization**: Optimize NiFi workflows for performance, scalability, and fault tolerance.

- **Monitoring**: Utilize NiFi’s monitoring tools to track data flow, identify bottlenecks, and handle errors proactively.

# *Outcome*:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Apache NiFi in building robust, automated data pipelines for file processing and real-time data streaming. By integrating NiFi with Kafka, it provides a scalable and efficient solution for handling large volumes of data, enabling seamless integration with modern data-driven architectures.
